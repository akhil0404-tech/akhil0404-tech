## 🧑‍🏫 Graduate Teaching Assistant @ FAU | Jan 2024 – Apr 2025

I worked as a GTA for **Data Mining & Machine Learning**, where I supported students with:
- Excel-based analytics (XLMiner)
- Python ML workflows
- Data preprocessing and modeling
- One-on-one project mentoring and guidance

This role has helped me solidify my fundamentals while also developing a knack for teaching and breaking down complex ideas.

## 💼 Industry Experience: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India

Before moving to the U.S., I worked as a **System Engineer** at **TCS**, where I handled data engineering and analytics work across large-scale banking and telecom systems.

My work primarily involved:

- Writing and optimizing complex queries using **Oracle SQL** and developing robust **PL/SQL procedures and packages**.
- Designing and deploying **dynamic Power BI dashboards** with DAX measures, role-based security, bookmarks, and custom KPIs, enabling real-time insights for finance, compliance, and operations.
- Developing **ETL pipelines using Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)** to move data from the **Data Staging Area (DSA)** to the **Operational Data Warehouse (ODW)**.
- Executing and scheduling backend ingestion processes with **KornShell (KSH)** scripts on **UNIX servers**, which helped automate daily batch loads.
- Performing **data transformation and cleansing** for large telecom datasets, ensuring clean and audit-ready data pipelines.
- Embedding dashboards into internal portals using **JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3** for responsive, interactive BI experiences.
- Setting up **Power BI Gateway** for automated refreshes from Oracle, Excel, and shared drives — eliminating manual reporting.
- Working with **Google Cloud** tools like **BigQuery** for scalable SQL analysis and **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for handling batch files and backups.
- Delivering **Excel-based reporting solutions** using pivot tables, VLOOKUP, conditional formatting, and Power Query-based data validation.

These hands-on experiences taught me how to think end-to-end — from raw data ingestion and cleansing, to building automated dashboards that speak to real business problems. It also sparked my deep interest in **data engineering**, automation, and scalable cloud-based analytics.
